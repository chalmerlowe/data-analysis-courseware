# * Define an `__init__()` method that takes a two parameters and assigns them to `color` and `mpg` (miles per gallon) attributes respectively
# * Define a method called `set_color` that takes in a parameter and assigns that to `color`
# * Define a method called `print_specs` that prints the values associatd with `color` and `mpg`
# * Create an object based on your class.
