"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The frumious Bandersnatch!"<br>

<p>

He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time the manxome foe he sought --<br>
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood awhile in thought.<br>

<p>

And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And burbled as it came!<br>

<p>

One, two!  One, two!  And through and through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
He left it dead, and with its head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He went galumphing back.<br>

<p>

"And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
O frabjous day!  Callooh!  Callay!'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He chortled in his joy.<br>
