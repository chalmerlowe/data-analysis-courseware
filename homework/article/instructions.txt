Homework: 

You will create a blog article class (a blueprint)
Your class will allow you to store data related specifically to a single article.

To accomplish the tasks below, you will also need to research the datetime library to determine how to create a datetime timestamp (a string).

Your class should include the following attributes:
* .author
* .title
* .content       # the text of the article
* .datetime      # the date and time the article was published
* .tags     
* .status        # draft, published


Your class should include the following behaviors:
* .set_author()         # set the author
* .set_title()          # set the title of the article
* .set_content()        # set the content (i.e. a string of text)
* .set_publish_date()   # create a datetime object and store the string representation of that datetime
* .set_tags()           # create a set of tags (store them in a list)
* .set_status()         # set the status to either 'Draft' OR 'Published'

Once you have made your class, create two blog articles and store them in a list.

Parse through the articles in the list and print the attributes for each article to the screen.
