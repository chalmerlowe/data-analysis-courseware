Schedule:
Apr 25
* artist_01: df.sort_values()
* artist_02: df.describe()
* artist_03: df.nlargest()

May 9
* artist_04: df.quantile()
* artist_05: df.astype()
* artist_07: df.isin()
* artist_11: df.clip()

Desired outcomes:

* learn something new about your method OR function
* share what you have learned in about five minutes
* practice the process of researching for understanding versus the "getting a quick answer"

Expections:
* provide us with the syntax and arguments available. for example, here are the
  syntax and arguments available for print():

  print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

* provide some information about the most important or most used arguments 
  so that we have a good sense of how/when you might use those arguments
  
* provide some code examples showing that method/attribute in use so we can see what happens when you use that method OR function

If you have questions, please let me know.
